## 👋 Meet Storyscript
The [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for **Application Storytelling**.
Develop rapidly, deploy natively to the cloud and focus on what matters most: business-logic.
Designed with :heart: by [Storyscript](https://storyscript.io) on a mission to bring application development to the next level.

```coffee
# Applications are stories of data.
when http server listen path: '/' as request     # Serverless
    result = anyMicroservice action key: value   # Written in any language wrapped in Docker or RKT
    result = anyFunction(key: value)             # Lambda, OpenFaaS, KNative or Storyscript
    items = 'string' split by: ','               # Mutations == No middleware
    data = OpenAPI get users: users              # OpenAPI & AsyncAPI for legacy system support
    sent = machinebox/textbox process input:data # Free/Paid Serivces
    if sent.positive                             # Conditions
        foreach list as item                     # Turing complete
            # ...
    request write content: 'Hello World!'

# Next launch on the Storyscript Platform
$ story deploy  # Zero-devop deployments into Kubernetes
